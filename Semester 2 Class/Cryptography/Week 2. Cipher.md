CRYPTO IS THE BEST

##### Formula
C = Enc(k,P) = (P+k) mod 26
P = Dec(k,C) = (C-k) mod 26

Encode, WAR STARTS TOMORROW, K = 5

##### Brute Force
- Caesar cipher easy to break, since we just need try k 26 times, and get the result

GCUA VQ DTGCM
EASY TO BREAK, k = 2


##### Monoalphabetic Cipher
- one to one mapping or characters
- easy to break, since its one to one
- weak in language characteristics, e.g. in english, e is most used, and z,j,k,q,x are rarely used, we can use freq. analysis here

##### Polyalphabetic Cipher
- Use more than 1 characters in the process
- Vigenere Cipher -> example

##### Vigenere Cipher
Key + Ptx mod 26 = C
- using autokey cipher, key length based on plaintext
