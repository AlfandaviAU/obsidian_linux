#### Instruction Cycle 
1. Fetch : Takes next instruction address from IAR
2. Decode : Decode from binary 
3. Execute : Fetch operands from register/memory, and process in ALU or CU
4. Store : Store the value

	 Each processor type has differennt type of low-level assembly language -> depend on Instruction Set Architecture
