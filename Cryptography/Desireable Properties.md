1. Recover the original plaintext
	1. Inversable
	2. No information loss
2. Obscures statistical properties
	1. Avoid cryptanalysis attack 
3. Avalanche effect
	1. Small  change in either the plaintext or key -> significant change in ciphertext
4. Unconditional security
	1. no matter how much computer power is available, cipher cannot be broken
5. Computational security
	1. time needed for computation is greater than useful age of information
	2. cost of breaking ciipher >>> value of encrypted information

Combine elements
1. Confusion => Substitution
	1. Make relationship between plaintext and ciphertext complex and nonlinearDiffusion
2. Diffusion => Transposition / Permutation
	1. Spread the influence of individual plaintext  elemenets, to entire ciphertext
