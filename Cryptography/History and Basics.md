#### History
- ~600BCE : Ancient Greeks using scytale for encryption
- ~60 BCE : Caesar cipher in Roman Empire
- ~850 CE : Al-Kindi (Cryptanalysis) 
- Enigma for encryption (Nazi German)
- Cracking Enigma (Alan Turing)
- 1970s : Modern Cryptography

#### Terminology
- Plaintext : Original Message
- Ciphertext : Encoded Message
- Cipher : Algorithm for transforming plaintext - ciphertext
- Key : Secret info in cipher (only known to sender and receiver)
- Encrypt : Convert plaintext -> ciphertext
- Decrypt : Convert ciphertext -> plaintext

#### Fundamental Problem
1. Alice and Bob want send message to each other
2. But they sending it on public channel
3. So they use cryptography to secure it 
4. And noone can know about their secret
